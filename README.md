A React-based Password Manager application that allows users to store, view, search, and manage their saved passwords securely.

Features:

Users can add passwords by providing a website, username, and password.

Initially, the input fields for the website, username, and password are empty, and a 'No Passwords View' is displayed.

When a password is added, it appears in the list with the password hidden as stars (***) by default.

A count of stored passwords is displayed and updates dynamically as passwords are added or deleted.

Users can toggle the visibility of passwords by selecting the 'Show Password' checkbox.

The search bar allows users to filter passwords based on the website name (case-insensitive search).

If no matching passwords are found during a search, the 'No Passwords View' is displayed.

Users can delete individual passwords, and the count updates accordingly.

When all passwords are deleted, the 'No Passwords View' is shown again.
